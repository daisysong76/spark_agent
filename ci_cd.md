CI/CD Integration
We can orchestrate everything in a single Jenkinsfile or GitHub Actions workflow. For example, the pipeline might:

Run Spark ingestion/cleaning on new data.
Run Spark embedding generation.
Update vector store.
Build & push Docker image for the AI agent.
Apply K8s manifests to deploy or update the service.
See the previous answer for a template Jenkinsfile / GitHub Actions YAML.


You now have a complete “big-data + AI agent” project featuring:

Spark-based ingestion & cleaning of large text corpora.
Distributed embedding generation with Transformers.
Storage of embeddings in a vector database (Milvus).
AI Agent (FastAPI) that does retrieval-augmented Q&A.
Integration with external APIs (phone calls, email, LinkedIn, Google Search) using a simple tool-calling approach.
CI/CD references (Jenkinsfile / GitHub Actions) for automation.
With this project structure, you can handle large-scale text data and let your AI agent both answer questions and perform real-world actions like calling a phone number, sending email, or searching the web, all in one unified system.
